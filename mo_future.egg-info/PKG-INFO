        More future! Make Python 2/3 compatibility a little bit easier
        
        Details
        -------
        
        All the data types that have changed, and all the libraries that have
        moved, are put into the ``mo-future`` top-level module so it is easy to
        find.
        
        **This module is only intended for the ``mo-*`` series of libraries, but
        pull requests are welcome**
        
        Replaces ``future`` or ``six``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Many of the compatibility types declared by ``future`` or ``six`` are in
        ``mo-future``
        
        Flat namespace
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        All compatibility types are top-level
        
        Instead of
        
        .. code:: python
        
                from future.utils import text_type
        
        you get the same, but without having to discover what sub-module the
        ``text_type`` is hiding:
        
        .. code:: python
        
                from mo_future import text_type
        
        Simpler imports
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Instead of writing conditional imports like
        
        .. code:: python
        
                try:
                    from io import StringIO
                except:
                    from StringIO import StringIO
        
        or
        
        .. code:: python
        
                if PY3:
                    from io import StringIO
                else:
                    from StringIO import StringIO
        
        you can use ``mo-future``:
        
        .. code:: python
        
                from mo_future import StringIO
